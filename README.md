# Wise Play Game Grove (WPGG)

The purpose of this application will be to assist people (such as myself) who have too many games in their Steam library. Sometimes I will buy a game just because its on sale and totally forget about it! Or I will start a game and play for a few hours, only to forget where I was or why I was playing it.

This application will allow a user to categorize the games in their Steam library, as well as attach notes and reminders to their games for future reference. It will also allow a user to see the gameplay hours per dollar of the games they own.

Stretch Goal: Allow the application to recommend the next game to buy or play based on the user's input (perhaps after answering a few questions).
